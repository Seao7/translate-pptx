## 📦 Requirements

- `streamlit`
- `python-pptx`
- `googletrans==4.0.0-rc1`

See `requirements.txt` for the full list.

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations

- **Googletrans is unofficial**—the app may break if Google changes its backend.
- Does not handle text embedded inside **images or diagrams**—only text boxes are translated.
- No automatic text resizing—if Japanese translation expands the text size, formatting may need manual adjustments.
- Potential compatibility issues with **Python 3.13+**, as `cgi` module was removed in Python 3.13 which is required by some dependencies like `httpx`.  
  **Recommended: Use Python 3.10 or 3.11 for local running.**

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Possible)

- Switch to an official translation API (e.g., DeepL, Google Cloud Translate).
- Support for translating PDF files.
- Auto-resizing fonts based on translated text length.
